shell

./file.sh
. reprsents pwd
so we have to provide full path of exe file

echo ""
if we don't use "" then extra space will not be counted

echo ''		#strong quote

var name can't be reserved words
no whitespace b/w words

we should not use spacing in declaring var
bcz after space it will consider it as another var,
and when not found it will throw error
"cmd not found"

$#  //count no. of cmd line args
$@  //print all cmd line args passed  {word}
$*  //print all cmd line args passed  {string}

`` //old method
$() //new method

date +"%D-%T"
